# bounty-hunters

Open a ticket or contact me via Spigot DM/Discord if you need anything. Don't hesitate to have a look at the wiki, it presents the main plugin & API features.

If you would like to contribute to the plugin development, you can report an issue and indicate how it can be reproduced, or even write a feature request which I might add to the plugin.. The bravest can also directly implement their suggestion via a pull request.
